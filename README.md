# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
For this project, we've analyzed multiple factors to determine what makes for a successful Kickstarter.

Based on the graph below, we've determined that May/June is the best time for a Kickstarter to launch as during those months there is shown to be a greater success rate. December has the lowest success rate and is best avoided, likely due to the holidays being the main focus for most people during that time.

Around less than $1000 seems to be at a stable rate of beign funded about 80% of the time while the odds go down significantly in the $25,000 area. There seems to be a high potential to meet goals at around $35-50,000 as well, but it should be noted that the highest, successful Kickstarter featuring a play, was in Sweden, while most of the others were USA. As a result, it would be more beneficial to aim for under $100,000 as a goal.
